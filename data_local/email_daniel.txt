Hi Tak,

There is structural MRI data available for Schiz_COBRE. I'm putting the rest of slab on this email in case there are processing issues with the Schiz_COBRE VBM data that I'm not aware of.

Here's an example path (you can of course replace 0040096 to find other subject's data)

/net/data4/Schiz_COBRE/Subjects/0040096/session_1/rest_1/coReg/

There are two files in this folder you will probably want to use.

m0wrp1mprage.nii
m0 - bias corrected (this corrects for differences in inter-subject brain volume)
wrp - warped
1 - tissue type (1 - Gray, 2 - White, 3 - Cerebrospinal Fluid)
mprage - image type

and possibly
m0wrp2mprage.nii
which is the white matter volume map. 

There is also m0wrp3mprage.nii which is cerebrospinal fluid, but we generally don't look at those.
